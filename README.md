# SSH Connect by elCamilet

**SSH Connect** is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to manage and connect to SSH servers directly from the interface. It provides a hierarchical view to organize your servers into groups, make quick connections, and easily edit configurations.

## Features

- **Hierarchical view of SSH servers**:
  - Group and organize your servers by categories (e.g., Development, Production).
  - View server details like name, user, port, and SSH identity file in configuration file.

- **Quick server connection**:
  - Connect to a server with a single click from the SSH servers tree.

- **Customizable configuration**:
  - Auto-generated JSON configuration file to define groups and servers.

- **Real-time updates**:
  - Saved changes in the configuration file are automatically reflected in the view.

- **Custom Shell configuration**:
  - You can specify your custom shell (zsh, bash, fish, ...) in the configuration file.

- **Encrypted SSH Passwords**:
  - Store passwords securely in the operating system's credential store.
  - Connect directly to servers with stored passwords.

   - Navigate to the sidebar and find the **SSH Hosts** view.

2. **Connect to a server**:
   - Click on a server to start an SSH connection in an integrated terminal.

3. **Edit configuration**:
   - Use the `Edit configuration file` command from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) to edit the `ssh-config.json` file.

4. **Save passwords**:

### Example Structure:

```json
{
  "defaultShell": "/bin/bash",
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "defaultUser": "root",
      "defaultPort": 22,
      "defaultIdentityFile": "",
      "hosts": [
        {
          "host": "dev1.example.com",
          "name": "Development Server 1",
          "user": "devuser",
          "port": 2222,
          "identityFile": "~/.ssh/dev-cert.pem"
        },
        {
          "host": "10.10.0.1",
          "name": "Development Server 2"
        },
        {
          "host": "10.10.0.2",
          "name": "Development Server 3",
          "user": "devuser2",
          "port": 222,
          "identityFile": "/tmp/cert.pem",
          "useGroupPassword": "no",
          "useIdentityFile": "yes"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "defaultUser": "ec2-user",
      "defaultPort": 22,
      "defaultIdentityFile": "/path/to/prod-cert.pem",
      "hosts": [
        {
          "host": "example.com",
          "name": "Production Server 1",
          "user": "admin",
          "port": 22,
          "identityFile": "~/.ssh/prod-cert.pem"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- **Group configuration**:
  - `name`: The name of the group.
  - `defaultUser`: The default user to connect as. Defaults to `root`.
  - `defaultPort`: The default port to connect to. Defaults to `22`.
  - `defaultIdentityFile`: The default path to the SSH identity file.
  - `hosts`: An array of host configurations.

- **Minimum host configuration**:
  - `host`: The host name or IP address.
  - `name`: The visible name of the host.

- **Optional host configuration**:
  - `user`: The user to connect as.
  - `port`: The port to connect to.
  - `identityFile`: The path to the SSH identity file.
  - `useGroupPassword`: Whether to use the group password or not ("yes" | "no").
  - `useIdentityFile`: Whether to use the identity file or not ("yes" | "no").

## Requirements

- `sshpass` package installed in your system. It's used to connect directly with stored passwords.

- An operating system that supports integrated terminals in Visual Studio Code, like Linux. 

- The `ssh-config.json` file must exist for the extension to work correctly. If it does not exist, it will be automatically created with a basic template.
